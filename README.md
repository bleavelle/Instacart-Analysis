# Instacart-Analysis
*A bootcamp project that required using Python and Jupyter to first clean, organize, and merge multiple large data sets. After data was combined and organized, I then used Python to visualize certain aspects of this data.*

# Project Description

## A quick comment in praise of the design of this course
For this project, I was given a few very large (to me) datasets, and had to use Python to clean and analyze them. Something I found particularly great about this project is the amount of *learning by doing* that was required. Answers and methods to find them were not always given, so there was a lot of Googling that had to be done to find solutions for myself. I came out of it with a good understanding of a few fundamental techniques for handling data in Python, but also a huge respect for the amount of knowledge there is for me to gain if I continue to practice with it. 

In short, this project made me fall in love with Python.


## Some Key Skills Gained
The files in this repository contain Jupyter files of all of the work I had to do for this project, but I would like to give a quick summary of some of the skills I gained while working on this project:
- Troubleshooting Python and Jupyter when the programs themselves are not cooperating
- Understanding how to read the Python language, making searching for answers and finding my own errors much easier
- Merging large data sets based on specific keys
- Creating category flags to further filter data to gain insight
- Using loc() instead of loops to make filtering more efficient
- Using crosstabs to quickly find possible interesting relationships between variables
- Importing data and saving as dataframes, exporting dataframes into various file formats
-
