# Instacart-Analysis
*A bootcamp project that required using Python and Jupyter to first clean, organize, and merge multiple large data sets. After data was combined and organized, I then used Python to visualize certain aspects of this data.*

# Project Description

## A quick comment in praise of the design of this course
For this project, I was given a few very large (to me) datasets, and had to use Python to clean and analyze them. Something I found particularly great about this project is the amount of *learning by doing* that was required. Answers and methods to find them were not always given, so there was a lot of Googling that had to be done to find answers for myself, and I really came out of it with a good understanding of a few great techniques for handling data in Python, but also a huge respect for the amount of knowledge there is for me to gain if I continue to practice with it. 

In short, this project made me fall in love with Python.
